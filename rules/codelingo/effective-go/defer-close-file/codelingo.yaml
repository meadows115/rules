        title: Defer Close File
        body: |
          Deferring a call to a function such as Close has it's advantages. Firstly, it guarantees that 
          you will never forget to close the file, a common mistake if you later edit the function 
          to add a new return path. Secondly, it means that the Close sits near the open of the function, which is clearer 
          than placing it at the end.
          TODO if a function returns the open file, follow it and check if it is closed.

          ## Bad code
          ```golang
          // CopyFile copies a file from dst to src
          func CopyFile(dstName, srcName string) (written int64, err error) {
            src, err := os.Open(srcName)
            if err != nil {
              return
            }

            dst, err := os.Create(dstName)
            if err != nil {
              return
            }

            return io.Copy(dst, src)
          }
          ```

          ## Good code
          ```golang
          // CopyFile copies a file from dst to src
          func CopyFile(dstName, srcName string) (written int64, err error) {
            src, err := os.Open(srcName)
            if err != nil {
              return
            }
            defer src.Close()

            dst, err := os.Create(dstName)
            if err != nil {
              return
            }
            defer dst.Close()

            return io.Copy(dst, src)
          }
          ```
