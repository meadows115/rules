        title: Good Package Name
        body: |
          A package name should be short and concise. Everyone using the
          package should use the same name to refer to its contents.
          By convention, packages are given lower case, single-word names. 
          There is no need for underscores or mixedCaps. Do not worry about 
          collisions a priori. The package name is only the default name for 
          imports; it need not be unique across all source code, and in the 
          rare case of a collision the importing package can choose a different 
          name to use locally. In any case, confusion is rare because the file
          name in the import determines which package is being used.

          ## Bad code
          ```golang
          // list_to_implement_a_linked_list is a package that implements a doubly linked list.
          package list_to_implement_a_linked_list
          ```

          ## Good code
          ```golang
          // list is a package that implements a doubly linked list.
          package list 
          ```
